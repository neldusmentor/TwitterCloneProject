Twitter clone assignment from Chas

Requirement: 

You are going to build a stripped-down twitter clone. The application should be written in Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript with Spring MVC as a framework.

 

The following features should be supported:

    • The user should be able to register an account, login and logout

    • The user should be able to write a status update, no more than 160 characters

    • The user should be able to follow and unfollow other users

    • The user should be able to view a list of their tweets as well as all tweets from the people they follow. These should be presented in descending chronological order 

Other requirements are:

    • The data should be stored in a database (no plaintext-file magic)

    • The code should be readable and commented

    • The code should be properly tested (around 70% unit test coverage is a good guideline)

    • The code quality does not have to be stellar, but try to make it as maintainable and structured as possible

    • Graphics and front-end programming (like JavaScript) are not taken into consideration, as long as the application is usable
